This is a demostration of path-finding algorithms. User can draw start point, end point, and barriers on the game board.  The program would find the shortest path from start to end

## Requires:  
python 3.8.6  
pygame 2.0.1  
  
## Instructions:  
run game.py to start
'space' -- finding the shorted path  
'esc' -- reset the game board  

## To-do list:  
1. implement 'run' and 'reset' button
2. feedback result
