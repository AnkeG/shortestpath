# Shortest Path

This is a demostration of path-finding algorithms. User can draw start point, end point, and barriers on the game board.  The program would find the shortest path from start to end

Requires:  
python 3.8.6  
pygame 2.0.1  
  
Instructions:  
run board.py to start  
'b' -- set mouse function to setting barriers  
'e' -- set mouse function to select start/end points (only allow two points)  
'space' -- finding the shorted path  
'esc' -- reset the game board  

To-do list:  
1. limit to two end points
2. add animation to show the path finding process
3. clearer GUI for set barrier and end points
4. implementing A * path finding as second spt option
