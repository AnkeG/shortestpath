# Shortest Path

This is a demostration of path-finding algorithms. User can draw start point, end point, and barriers on the game board.  The program would find the shortest path from start to end

## Requires:  
python 3.8.6  
pygame 2.0.1  
  
## Instructions:  
run game.py to start  
'a' -- enable animation
'b' -- set mouse function to setting barriers  
'd' -- set to dijkstra
'e' -- set mouse function to select start/end points (only allow two points)
's' -- set to a * path finding
'space' -- finding the shorted path  
'esc' -- reset the game board  

## To-do list:  
1. using a tkinter window for settings
