# Shortest Path

This is a demostration of path-finding algorithms. User can draw start point, end point, and barriers inbetween.  The program would find the shortest path from start to end

To-do list:
1. add the basic Dijkstra algorithm
2. build data structure with pygame board
3. show the path-finding process with hard-code start and end point
4. add barriers
5. GUI to pick start and end point
